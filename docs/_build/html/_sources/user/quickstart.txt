Quickstart
==========

When every :ref:`requirements <requirements>` are met, you'll need to launch the X server::

    $ startx
    $ export DISPLAY=:0.0

Then, you can launch the server using the script server.py::

    $ python server.py

The web server is available at the Raspberry Pi's IP address on the port 5000. If the ip address of your Raspberry is 10.4.9.4, you can access the server at `http://10.4.9.4:5000 <http://10.4.9.4:5000>`_. You can then launch your game using the button 'Start game'.
